### Download Your Statements

1. Log into your Chime account and navigate to your Documents:
   [https://app.chime.com/settings/documents](https://app.chime.com/settings/documents)
2. Click on the `PDF` link on the right.
3. Download **every statement you can!**

Place all your statements in a single folder and name them like:

```text
Your_Name_Checking_eStatement (1).pdf
Your_Name_Checking_eStatement (2).pdf
```

---

## Importing Your Statements

The importer parses your Chime statements into a SQLite database for analysis. For details on setting up and running the importer, see the [README in the `importer` folder](./importer/README.md).

## Running the App

This app allows you to interact with your imported Chime transactions using AI. Once you've set up your `transactions.db` using the importer:

1. **Start the AI Interface** (Coming Soon):
   ```bash
   ./chime-ai
   ```

2. **Ask Questions About Your Transactions**:
    - "How much did I spend on dining last month?"
    - "What are my recurring subscriptions?"
    - "Show me my largest transactions in the past year."
